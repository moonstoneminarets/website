## What I am Looking For

I'm looking for fiction for adult and young-adults, primarily novels. I will also consider short story collections and novellas. Genre and topic can cover anything in the diverse breadth of fantasy, science-fantasy, and science fiction; perhaps horror, or other genres, if they're good.

Content must meet my criteria for being "Islamically acceptable," which you can read about on the [about page](/about.html). This is also subject to my discretion, as you might sometimes need to break the rules to deliver your book's message. It should also be between 60-700 pages in length.

**Please do not send your work until you feel it's ready to be published to the world!** Due to time and resource limitations, I can only read it once, and I don't accept "updated" versions later on; you get one shot to make a great impression, so make it good!

## What I am not Looking For

- Anything you didn't write or own the copyright to (obviously)
- Books that go against [our values](about.html)
- Non-Fiction, historical fiction, and other types of books (e.g. biographies, recipe books)
- Books suitable for children 12 and under
- Poetry
- Anything not written in English
- Anything you've already published elsewhere - digitally or in paper

If your book meets any of the above criteria, you should submit it elsewhere.

## What I Offer 

Since Moonstone Minarets is a one-man project, I can offer:

- Review your book manuscript and report whether it meets our criteria
- Review your book manuscript and provide broad, sweeping suggestions to make your writing more direct, concise, and impactful
- Create a few cover options, and a final cover (using generative AIs)
- Publish your book, as a paper book, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Barns & Noble, Blackwells, etc.)
- Publish your book, as a ebook, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Apple Store, Hoopla, etc.)
- Publish your book to libraries (e.g. OverDrive/Libby, Odilo, Bibliotheca, Hoopla, etc.)

To see a complete and current list of stores, both digital and paper, check out our [Facts About Palestine page](http://localhost:8000/books/facts-about-palestine.html).

Note that, as the publisher, I acquire the rights to publish your book in print and ebook formats, worldwide, in all languages.

## Payment

In exchange for my services, I keep **20%** of any profit the book makes **(after expenses)**. For example, if you publish a paperback on Amazon for $10:

- Amazon and the publishing platform take $8.29
- The "gross" profit is $1.71
- My cut is 20%, which is $0.34 (round down)
- Your cut is 80%, which is $1.37 (round up)

I pay you when I get paid, which is typically weeks to months after someone actually purchases the book (due to payment confirmations, waits for refunds, payout thresholds, etc.).

## Submission Process

If you would like to proceed, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/5y4eq3tKYGK1RAym8) to submit your final, complete, publishing-ready manuscript.

If another venue agrees to publish your work, which you submitted to me, congratulations! Please [contact me](mailto:alibhai.ashiq@gmail.com) to withdraw your submission.
