I started Moonstone Minarets in 2024 with a simple goal: to provide an easy way for readers to find Islamic works of fantasy and sci-fi. I got tired of reading sci-fi and fantasy works -- sometimes with Muslim characters! -- rife with propaganda, or values and morals in opposition to Islam.

As a voracious reader, as a parent, as an uncle, I promise you this: you can feel comfortable that it contains wholesome, Islamic values; and doesn't promote inappropriate values. This includes, as a non-exhaustive list:

- Swearing and curse-words
- Nudity and/or sex
- Inappropriate relationships
- Propaganda
- Glorifying major sins
- Glorifying <dfn title="the worship, broadly, of any deity other than God">shirk</dfn>
