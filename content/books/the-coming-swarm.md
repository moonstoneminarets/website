When an ancient prison beneath a forgotten moon begins to fail, a lone Tromian engineer witnesses something impossible awaken. Across the galaxy, a stolen relic of the same origin vanishes into the underworld of deep-space trade, drawing thieves, scientists, and mercenaries into a spiraling mystery.

From the Korithal ruins of Theta-9 to the crowded markets of Station Keshal-7, eight intelligent species confront the same terror — a hunger older than civilization itself.

As the Stellar Alliance scrambles to contain the spreading signal, unlikely heroes emerge: a Nyssari thief haunted by what she's stolen, a disgraced Feydra merchant gambling for his family's lives, and a warrior who remembers the last time this darkness stirred.

The Coming Swarm launches **the Chyrrix Saga**, a sweeping space-opera thriller of alien civilizations, buried sins, and the terrible cost of awakening what was meant to sleep forever.
