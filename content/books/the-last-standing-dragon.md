When Bilal's mother disappears without a trace, the young dragon and his friends set out on a daring journey to find her. But the world beyond their peaceful valley is full of strange whispers, forgotten islands, and powerful secrets.

From escaping a grumpy ogre to meeting a mysterious wyvern with a painful past, Bilal and his friends must trust each other—and their wings—to brave the unknown. Guided only by the wind and their unbreakable bond, they face curses, ancient magic, and the chilling return of a dark force thought long forgotten.

The Last Standing Dragon is a thrilling middle grade fantasy filled with heart, humor, and high-flying adventure. Perfect for readers who love magical creatures, tight-knit friendships, and stories where even the smallest voice can change the fate of the world.

Can a group of young dragons save one of their own—and stand against a rising shadow?
